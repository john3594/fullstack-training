I was asked by numerous students to split module 4 into two modules.

This is why you are now seeing a 'version2' folder in the Assignments folder.

"version2" is the version 2 of this course, i.e., the one with module 4 split
into 2 modules: Module 4 and Module 5.

There are NO NEW LECTURES OR MATERIAL. I just made a logical split and created 2
modules out of previous 1. I hope that's clear.

The old Module 4 assignment is now the version2 Module 5 Assignment.

The new Module 4 got its own (additional) assignment. In this directory,
I provide you with 2 solution starters. If you're a more advanced student,
I suggest you use the module4-solution-starter/harder version. If you are a
fairly beginner student, I suggest you start with module4-solution-starter/easier
version.

If anything not clear, please feel free to ask your questions in the Coursera
Discussions.
